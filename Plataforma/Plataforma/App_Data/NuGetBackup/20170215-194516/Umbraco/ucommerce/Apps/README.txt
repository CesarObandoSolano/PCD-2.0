Place your custom uCommerce configurations in this folder. uCommerce will automatically pick up all config files in this folder.

If you wish to disable a config file or folder, you can suffix the folder or file name with the ".disabled" extension, 
which casues uCommerce to ignore a file or a folder (and everthing in it).
